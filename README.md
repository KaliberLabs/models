# Kaliber Labs fork of Tensor Flow Models

It contains tools for detecting people and objects. 

* models/ contains tensorflow models and tools
* models/app/ contains wrappers around tensorflow models for use in applications

Tools

* models/app/detect_humans.py is a CLI tool that detects all the humans in a frame and writes to CSV.
* models/app/draw_rects.py is an UNFINISHED CLI tool to draw rectangles around people in jpegs
* models/app/model_download.py is a small program that downloads a TF model
* models/app/api.py is an UNTESTED, NEVER USED REST wrapper around the detection model
* models/app/humans.py is a library module that provides a usable abstraction around tensorflow code


### Running the people detection model server

Copy a tensorflow model

    cd ~
    clone this repo into $HOME
    cd models/object_detection
    aws s3 cp s3://kaliber-face-experiments/es/faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco_11_06_2017_people_detector.pb .
    cd ../app

Check that in config.py are correct.


    python app/api.py  

    If you get an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) error, increase the GPU size or run the model on RAM like this:

    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" python app/api.py  

  
You can submit jpg images  like this:
